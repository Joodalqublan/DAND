# Communicate Data Finding Project


In this project, will analyze and explore if there a relation between variables. ford gobike data of the period  (January 2018) from the Bay Wheels trip dataset.
I download it from :  https://s3.amazonaws.com/fordgobike-data/index.html


The first step of the wrangle, is gathering then cleaning then analyze . 

 # 1- Univariate Exploration insights :

92.77% of users are subscribed and 7.23% are Customer.
males gender much more than females in this dataset.
ford go bike Start was increased over the month day.
Numbers of Males are more than Females, also the numbers of the subscriber are more than a customer

 # 2-Bivariate Exploration insights :

the period of time is decreased with increasing age.
Most of the ages are between 20 - 60, and the median for males is 35 and for females 34.
It appears that there are three different stations at Ford Gobike Dataset..

 # 3- Multivariate Exploration insights :

Males take duration time more than Females in both Customer and subscriber
The Customer age are little less than subscriber age , and Females less than males.
This drawing confirms what we saw previously, that there are three starting stations , and two of them are near to each other.
There is a bit relationship between NO "bike share for all trip" and increased Age
